## Why Metabolism Slows Down After 40  

After 40, hormonal changes, muscle loss, and stress can slow your metabolism. But the biggest culprit? **Your mitochondria**—the tiny engines in your cells that turn food into energy. When mitochondria weaken, your body burns fewer calories, stores more fat, and leaves you feeling tired.

- 🔥 **Boost fat-burning mitochondria**
